		  <center><p>When I graduate from Babson, I want to continue to run my startups full time.
		     One of my startups is called <a href="http://www.climaxent.com">Climax Entertainment Group</a>. We provide marketing
		     consultancy, event planning, business consultancy, and media services to nightlife
		     companies in Boston and New York.</p></center>
		<br>
		  <center><p>My other company is <a href="http://www.vetxapp.com">VetX</a>. VetX is a mobile and web based application that allows
		     anyone with a smartphone or internet access to be able to skip traveling and waiting 
		     in line to see a vet for something that is probably a false alarm. It allows users 
		     to submit a request to consult a vet, provide a description and attach photos/videos,
		     and receive an almost instantaneous reply from a certified vet! It also allows the user 
		     to read/post in the community section to see what others have to say, as well as a feature 
		     to view available vets in their vicinity to perform a house call in more urgent times.</p></center>
		<br>
		  <center><p>One of my favorite sports is soccer. I like soccer because I have been playing it my whole life,
		     starting from the first grade all the way up to high school. My favorite soccer team is <a href="http://www.manutd.com">Manchester United.</a> I also enjoy flying drones
		     because I really like technology and taking photos, and drones allow me to do both of those.</p></center>
