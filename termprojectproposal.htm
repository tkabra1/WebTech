		<h1>Term Project Proposal</h1>
		<br>
		<p>My website will be a personal website for myself. I have wanted to build a personal site for a long time, 
			however my businesses have had about pages that talked about me and my involvement in the investing world. 
			However I would like to have the domain www.tankabra.com to have a bio about me, a list of the companies 
			I have invested in, and a contact form page. Each company logo on the portfolio page should highlight when
			I mouse over it and click through to that companyâ€™s website. After my graduation from Babson College, I 
			plan on being an angel investor alongside running my startups so I feel that this site is something that 
			is necessary and a tool for people to contact me / submit their business plans for approval. My target 
			audience is the young entrepreneurs as well as larger venture capitalist organizations and funds who may 
			be interested to read about my endeavors and investments, as well as my background. I want the landing page
			of my website to be in a blog format, with posts that I share about running a startup and the challenges
			we incurr on a daily basis as well investment advice. </p>
