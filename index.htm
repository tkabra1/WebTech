		  <h2>About Me</h2>
		  <a id="about"></a>
		  <p><img src="Images/boop.jpg" Width="250" Height="250"> When I graduate from <a href="http://www.babson.edu">Babson College</a>, I want to continue to run my startups full time.
		     One of my startups is called <a href="http://www.climaxent.com">Climax Entertainment Group</a>. We provide marketing
		     consultancy, event planning, business consultancy, and media services to nightlife
		     companies in Boston and New York. My other company is <a href="http://www.vetxapp.com">VetX</a>. VetX is a mobile and web based application that allows
		     anyone with a smartphone or internet access to be able to skip traveling and waiting 
		     in line to see a vet for something that is probably a false alarm. It allows users 
		     to submit a request to consult a vet, provide a description and attach photos/videos,
		     and receive an almost instantaneous reply from a certified vet! It also allows the user 
		     to read/post in the community section to see what others have to say, as well as a feature 
		     to view available vets in their vicinity to perform a house call in more urgent times.</p>
			
			 <p>PetX is the social media side that will be launched alongside. PetX will allow users to build their pet(s)' profiles which can be used in the VetX application also. It will be the first pet-only social media with stories, photos, videos and even a classified section for those looking for services for their pets! With over 4,000 users on our waitlist to be beta users, we are counting down to our very-near launch date! The inspiration for this idea came from my amazing cat named Boop, and you can see how she loves to sleep with me in the photo on the left! She is a rescue that Katherine and I adopted in May from a shelter that was going to put her down. Her previous owners had abused and abandoned her, so we took her in and she soon became a very important part of our little unit!</p>

			<h2>My Interests</h2>
			<a id="interest"></a>
		  <p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/4/005/093/0ca/3a2e60f.jpg" alt="Image Error - Please Refresh the Page" title="Tan Kabra" Width="175" Height="175"/>My hobbies include many activites, some of them being: photography, film, technology and gadgets, and spending time with my friends out at night. I have been taking photos for over 7 years now and I have worked with various well known wildlife groups, one of them being <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com">National Geographic</a>. I spent 2 months in Kenya and South Africa with a National Geographic on an expedition to document the great migration, which is the passing of wildabeasts and zebras from Kenya over to Tanzania. I also enjoy reading tech blogs and used to contribute product and app reviews to certain websites, such as Engadget and Tech Crunch. One of the things I do every year that I think is awesome is attending the Apple WWDC (World Wide Developer Conference) in California. At these events, I meet a lot of people that work in and enjoy the same technology industry that I work in and plan to work in, so it is a great networking opportunity. One of my favorite sports is soccer. I like soccer because I have been playing it my whole life,
		     starting from the first grade all the way up to high school. My favorite soccer team is <a href="http://www.manutd.com">Manchester United.</a> I also enjoy flying drones
		     because I really like technology and taking photos, and drones allow me to do both of those.</p>
